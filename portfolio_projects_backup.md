### 1. Optimizing Heat Transfer in Heat Sink Fin Arrays Using Computational Fluid Dynamics

**Course:** MCEN 4231/5231 - Computational Fluid Dynamics  
**Team:** Surya Sharon Raj Goda, Saravana Kumar Kodakinti Prakash, Anoop Subramanya, K. Vaikunth Keshav  

**Description:** This study investigates the optimal fin configuration for passive heat sinks using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Natural convection heat transfer was simulated in three different fin array configurations (6, 10, and 13 fins) to determine the optimal spacing that maximizes heat transfer while minimizing material usage. A monolithic coupling approach with the Boussinesq approximation was employed to solve the coupled Navier-Stokes and energy equations.

**Technologies:**
- ANSYS Fluent
- CFD
- MATLAB
- Monolithic Coupling
- Boussinesq Approximation

**Key Achievements:**
- Achieved 62% higher heat transfer rate with 10-fin configuration compared to 6-fin design
- 18% improvement over 13-fin configuration, demonstrating optimal spacing
- Validated numerical results against experimental correlations
- Demonstrated effectiveness of monolithic coupling for natural convection problems
